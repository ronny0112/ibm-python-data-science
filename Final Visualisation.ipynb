    "As a data analyst, you have been given a task to monitor and report US domestic airline flights performance. Goal is to analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve flight reliability thereby improving customer reliability.\n",

    "* Yearly airline performance report\n",
    "* Yearly average flight delay statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Year range is between 2005 and 2020.\n",

    "    1. Having empty html.Div and use the callback to Output the dcc.graph as the Children of that Div.\n",
    "    1. .Add a state variable in addition to callback decorator input and output parameter. This will allow us to pass extra values without firing the callbacks.Here, we need to pass two inputs chart type and year. Input is read only after user entering all the information. \n",
